# Architectural Migration History

This directory contains documentation from the **architectural refactoring** of the AI Workflow Orchestrator (early development phase).

## Timeline
**Date**: Early development (pre-October 2025)
**Duration**: Multiple weeks
**Goal**: Transform a 1,544-line monolithic component into a production-ready modular architecture

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Layer
**File**: `PHASE1_COMPLETE.md`
**Focus**: Type system and API service layer
- Created TypeScript type definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
- Extracted API service layer (`src/services/api.ts`)
- Established type safety foundation

### Phase 2: State Management
**File**: `PHASE2_COMPLETE.md`
**Focus**: Custom hooks and React Context
- Created `useChat`, `useRequests`, `useDocuments` hooks
- Implemented `AppContext` provider
- Separated state logic from UI components

### Phase 3: Component Architecture
**File**: `PHASE3_COMPLETE.md`
**Focus**: Component decomposition and organization
- Split monolithic component into modular pieces
- Created `src/components/ui/` for reusable components
- Established feature-based component structure

### Phase 4: Routing System
**File**: `PHASE4_COMPLETE.md`
**Focus**: React Router integration
- Implemented page-based routing
- Added lazy loading for code splitting
- Created nested route layouts

### Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure
**File**: `PHASE5_COMPLETE.md`
**Focus**: Comprehensive test coverage
- Set up Vitest and React Testing Library
- Created co-located test files
- Achieved 100% component test coverage (119 tests)

## Additional Documentation

- **`MIGRATION_PLAN.md`**: Original migration strategy and planning
- **`COMPONENT_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`**: Component integration completion report

## Key Outcomes

✅ **Production-ready architecture**
✅ **Full TypeScript type safety**
✅ **Modular component structure**
✅ **100% test coverage**
✅ **React Router navigation**
✅ **Lazy loading & code splitting**

## Relation to Other Migrations

This architectural migration was **completed before** the dependency migration (October 2025). The solid architectural foundation made the dependency upgrades significantly faster (84% time savings).

See `../dependencies/` for the October 2025 dependency upgrade documentation.
