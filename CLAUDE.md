# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered workflow orchestrator built with React, TypeScript, and the Anthropic Claude API. The application manages workflow requests through an intelligent chatbot interface with automated routing, requirement generation (BRD/FSD/Tech Specs), and **three distinct role-based views** (Requester/Developer/Management).

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered conversational intake that guides users through requirement gathering
- Smart routing to team members based on request type
- Automated generation of Business Requirements Document (BRD), Functional Specification Document (FSD), and Technical Specifications
- Dashboard with request tracking, priority levels, clarity scores, and workflow stages
- **Three-view system with role-based access control:**
  - **Requester View**: Submit and track personal requests
  - **Developer View**: Manage assigned work and team workflow
  - **Management View**: Full portfolio oversight with analytics
- **RevOps Optimization Features:**
  - SLA tracking with visual status badges (on-time/at-risk/overdue)
  - Team capacity monitoring with utilization indicators
  - Analytics dashboard with portfolio funnel and cycle time metrics
  - Document approval workflow with quality gates
  - Modern toast notifications for all user feedback

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start backend proxy server (required for API calls)
node server.js
# OR
npm run server

# Start frontend development server (opens at http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Start both servers simultaneously (runs in background)
npm run dev:full

# Run tests
npm test              # Watch mode
npm run test:run      # Run once
npm run test:ui       # With UI

# Build for production (TypeScript compile + Vite build)
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

**Important**: You must run both the backend proxy (port 3001) and frontend dev server (port 3000) for the application to work properly. Use `npm run dev:full` to start both at once.

## Environment Setup

The application requires an Anthropic API key for the backend proxy server:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with your API key (note: no `VITE_` prefix)
3. The key is used server-side in `server.js` via `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
4. The frontend makes requests to `http://localhost:3001/api/chat` instead of calling Anthropic directly

**Security Note**: The API key is never exposed to the client. All Claude API requests are proxied through the Express server running on port 3001.

## Architecture

**Status**: âœ… Production-ready architecture (All 5 phases complete)

### Type System
All data structures are defined in `src/types/index.ts`:
- **Domain types**: `Request` (includes `submittedBy` for requester tracking), `ChatMessage`, `RequestData`, `GeneratedDocs`, `TeamMember`
- **Enum types**: `RequestStage`, `Priority`, `UserMode`, `DocType`, `ViewType` (`'requester' | 'dev' | 'management'`), `TabType`, `SLAStatus`
- **API types**: `ClaudeApiRequest`, `ClaudeApiResponse`, `RoutingInfo`
- **RevOps types**: `SLAData`, `DocumentApproval`

### API Service Layer
All Claude API interactions are centralized in `src/services/api.ts`:
- `api.startIntakeConversation()` - Initial request intake
- `api.continueConversation()` - Multi-turn conversation
- `api.extractRequestData()` - Extract structured data from chat
- `api.routeRequest()` - Route to team member
- `api.generateDocuments()` - Create BRD/FSD/Tech Spec (sequential, 3 separate API calls)
- `api.generateSingleDocument()` - Create one document (BRD, FSD, or Tech Spec)
- `api.refineDocument()` - Update documents based on feedback

The service layer handles all HTTP requests to the backend proxy at `http://localhost:3001/api/chat`, which forwards to Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`).

**Document Generation Strategy**: Documents are generated sequentially using 3 smaller API calls (1000 tokens each) instead of 1 large call (4000 tokens). This provides:
- Faster individual responses (~3-5s per document)
- Better error recovery (single doc failure doesn't lose all docs)
- Real-time progress tracking (user sees which document is being generated)
- No JSON parsing errors (returns markdown directly)
- Concise, demo-friendly content (<200 words per document)

### State Management
Uses React Context (`AppProvider`) with custom hooks:
- **`useChat` hook**: `chatMessages`, `userInput`, `isProcessing`, `currentOptions`
- **`useRequests` hook**: `requests`, `selectedRequest`, `requestData`
- **`useDocuments` hook**: `generatedDocs`, `userMode`, `isGenerating`, `activeDocTab`, `docChatMessages`
- **View control**: `view` (requester/dev/management) - controls role-based access and filtering
- **Navigation**: React Router DOM for URL-based routing with auto-navigation on view change

### AI Integration Pattern
The application uses the API service layer for all Claude interactions:

1. **Initial request intake**: Conversational chatbot that extracts requirements through guided questions
2. **Follow-up conversation**: Processes user responses with strict prompt instructions to provide bullet-point options
3. **Document generation**: Creates BRD, FSD, and Technical Spec based on collected requirements and user experience level (Guided/Collaborative/Expert)
4. **Document refinement**: Allows iterative improvements to generated documents

### Request Workflow
Requests flow through stages: `Scoping` â†’ `Ready for Dev` â†’ `In Progress` â†’ `Review` â†’ `Completed`

Each request includes:
- Basic metadata (id, title, status, owner, priority, daysOpen)
- Clarity score (1-10)
- Activity log with timestamps
- Optional AI alerts for stalled requests

### UI Structure
Page-based routing with React Router:
- **`/`**: New request submission (SubmitPage) with AI chatbot interface
- **`/dashboard`**: Request list (DashboardPage) with stats, filtering, SLA badges, and team capacity widget
- **`/kanban`**: Kanban board (KanbanPage) with drag-and-drop workflow and SLA badges
- **`/analytics`**: Analytics dashboard (AnalyticsPage) with portfolio funnel, bottleneck detection, and cycle time trends
- **`/request/:id`**: Individual request detail (RequestDetailPage) with document generation and approval workflow
- **`*`**: 404 error page (NotFoundPage)

### Role-Based View System
The application provides three distinct user experiences with automatic filtering and navigation control:

**ðŸ‘¤ Requester View** (Demo user: Jessica Martinez)
- **Navigation**: Dashboard â†’ New Request
- **Filtering**: Shows only requests submitted by the user
- **Capabilities**: Submit requests, generate documents, review completed work
- **Auto-navigation**: Switches to Dashboard when view changes

**ðŸ’» Developer View** (Demo user: Sarah Chen)
- **Navigation**: Dashboard â†’ Kanban Board â†’ Analytics
- **Filtering**: Shows assigned requests + "Ready for Dev" stage requests
- **Capabilities**: Accept work, update status, complete requests
- **Auto-navigation**: Switches to Dashboard when view changes

**ðŸ“Š Management View** (Full oversight)
- **Navigation**: Dashboard â†’ Kanban Board â†’ Analytics
- **Filtering**: Shows ALL requests (no filtering)
- **Capabilities**: Read-only oversight, team capacity monitoring, SLA tracking
- **Auto-navigation**: Switches to Dashboard when view changes

**Implementation Details**:
- View state managed in `AppContext` (src/contexts/AppContext.tsx)
- Filtering logic in `DashboardPage.tsx`, `KanbanPage.tsx`, and `App.tsx`
- Request count updates dynamically based on filtered results
- Stage badges use `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping

Features lazy loading with code splitting, error boundaries, skeleton loaders, and toast notifications for optimal performance and UX.

## Key Functions

- `startConversation()`: Initiates new request with AI
- `continueConversation()`: Handles multi-turn conversation with strict prompt engineering for bullet-point options
- `generateRequirements(mode)`: Creates all three specification documents sequentially based on user experience level
- `refineDocument()`: Updates documents based on user feedback
- `viewRequestDetail(request)`: Opens request detail view (resets generation state)
- `updateRequestStage(requestId, newStage, note)`: Manages request workflow transitions
- `calculateSLA(request)`: Calculates SLA status based on complexity and creation date
- `approveDocument(docType, approver)`: Approves a document and enables stage transitions
- `areAllDocsApproved()`: Checks if all three documents are approved before allowing "Ready for Dev"

## Prompt Engineering Notes

The chatbot uses strict prompt instructions to:
- Ask one question at a time
- Provide 2-4 answer choices as bullet points (using "â€¢")
- Avoid asking follow-up questions or explaining technical concepts
- Extract structured JSON summaries after conversation completion

The system includes specific instructions to ensure options are ANSWERS (e.g., "Taking 5+ hours per week") not QUESTIONS (e.g., "How much time?").

## Tech Stack Details

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling (configured for port 3000 with auto-open)
- **React Router DOM v7** for URL-based navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **React Hot Toast** for modern toast notifications
- **Express.js** backend proxy server (runs on port 3001)
- **React Context** for state management with custom hooks
- **Vitest** for testing with React Testing Library
- **Proxied API calls** through Express backend for security
- **Code splitting** with lazy loading for optimal performance

## Known Patterns

- Mock data exists in the initial `requests` state (REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003)
- Console.log statements exist for debugging
- API responses are parsed in the service layer (`api.ts`)
- Documents are stored as markdown strings in state
- Error boundary wraps the entire application for graceful error handling
- Backend proxy server handles API authentication, frontend handles all application state
- No database (state is stored client-side only)
- Lazy loading with Suspense for code splitting
- Test coverage for UI components (Button, Card, Badge, ChatMessage)

## Critical Architecture Patterns

The application follows strict architectural patterns. **Detailed documentation** is available in the [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) directory:

- **[Dual-Server Architecture](docs/architecture/dual-server.md)** - Backend proxy for secure API key handling
- **[State Management](docs/architecture/state-management.md)** - React Context with composable hooks
- **[Component Strategy](docs/architecture/component-strategy.md)** - Component location rules
- **[Testing Philosophy](docs/architecture/testing.md)** - Testing approach and patterns

### Quick Reference

**Dual-Server** (both must run):
- Backend (port 3001): Express proxy with API key
- Frontend (port 3000): Vite dev server
- Start both: `npm run dev:full`

**State Management**:
- `useChat` â†’ Chatbot conversation state
- `useRequests` â†’ Request CRUD operations
- `useDocuments` â†’ Document generation state
- Composed in `AppContext`, no external state libraries

**Component Locations**:
- `src/components/ui/` â†’ Generic, no business logic
- `src/components/layout/` â†’ App-wide structure
- `src/features/[feature]/components/` â†’ Feature-specific
- `src/pages/` â†’ Route-level composition

**Testing**:
- Co-locate: `Component.test.tsx` next to `Component.tsx`
- Run single test: `npm test -- Component.test.tsx`
- See [testing docs](docs/architecture/testing.md) for patterns

## Migration Status

All architectural phases complete (see [docs/history/MIGRATION_PLAN.md](docs/history/MIGRATION_PLAN.md)). The codebase is production-ready with type safety, modular components, React Router navigation, comprehensive testing, error boundaries, and lazy loading.

## Claude Code Configuration

### Custom Sub-Agents

This project includes 9 specialized sub-agents in `.claude/agents/` for focused development tasks:

- **component-generator**: Creates React components following project architecture patterns
- **test-writer**: Writes Vitest tests for components following project test patterns
- **api-integration**: Adds new Claude API methods to service layer (`src/services/api.ts`)
- **technical-architect**: Reviews architectural decisions and ensures consistency with production-ready patterns
- **product-owner**: Reviews feature requests for business value and ensures product quality
- **project-manager**: Plans implementation, breaks down features, and coordinates development tasks
- **doc-updater**: Updates project documentation to reflect code changes
- **prompt-engineer**: Optimizes Claude API prompts in the service layer
- **revops-expert**: Provides strategic consultation on Revenue Operations workflow optimization, bottleneck detection, and process improvements

These agents are automatically invoked based on task context or can be explicitly called. Each has isolated context and limited tool access for security.

### Automated Hooks

The `.claude/hooks.json` file configures automated checks during Claude Code sessions:

- **UserPromptSubmit**: Validates both servers (ports 3000/3001) are running before each prompt
- **PreToolUse**: Blocks git commits of `.env` file to prevent API key exposure
- **PostToolUse**: Runs TypeScript type checking after editing `.ts`/`.tsx` files
- **PostToolUse**: Runs test suite after editing files in `src/` or test files
- **Stop**: Shows git status summary when session ends

These hooks enforce best practices automatically without manual intervention.

### GitHub Integration

The `.github/workflows/claude.yml` workflow enables @claude mentions in issues and PRs. Claude Code can respond to tasks in GitHub with read access to contents, pull requests, issues, and CI results.
